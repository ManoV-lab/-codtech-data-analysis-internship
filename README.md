## Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Built a Machine Learning model to predict outcomes from input features.

- **Tool:** scikit‑learn (Linear Regression)  
- **Dataset:** `study_hours_data.csv`  
- **Deliverable:** `Task2_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb`, `study_hours_data.csv`  
- **Summary:** Trained and evaluated a regression model to predict exam scores based on hours studied and interpreted results using evaluation metrics and visualization.

## Task 3 – Dashboard Development

Created a dashboard-style visualization to present insights clearly.

- **Tool:** Plotly (Google Colab)  
- **Dataset:** Study Hours vs Exam Score (sample dataset in notebook)  
- **Deliverable:** `Task3_Dashboard_Development.ipynb`  
- **Summary:** Designed a clean dashboard visual with scatter plot, trend line, KPI summary (Avg/Min/Max), and hover tooltips to make the relationship between study hours and exam scores easy to understand.

## Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

Performed sentiment analysis on text data using NLP techniques.

- **Tool:** TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression (scikit‑learn)  
- **Dataset:** IMDb Movie Reviews  
- **Deliverable:** `Task4_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`  
- **Summary:** Preprocessed text, converted reviews into TF‑IDF features, trained a classifier, evaluated results (accuracy/confusion matrix), and tested predictions on custom example reviews.
