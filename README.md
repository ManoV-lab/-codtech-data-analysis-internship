## Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Built a simple Linear Regression model in Google Colab to predict exam scores from hours studied.

- **Tool:** scikit‑learn  
- **Dataset:** study_hours_data.csv  
- **Deliverable:** Task2_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb  
- **Insight:** The model achieved a high R², accurately predicting scores based on study time.
## Task 3 – Dashboard Development

Built a dashboard-style visualization in Google Colab using Plotly to analyze the relationship between study hours and exam scores.

**What the dashboard shows**
- Scatter plot of student performance (each point = one data record)
- Color-coded scores for quick comparison
- A trend line to highlight the overall relationship between study time and performance
- KPI summary (Average, Minimum, Maximum score) displayed on the dashboard for quick insights

**Key insight**
- The dashboard clearly shows that higher study hours generally correspond to higher exam scores, making it useful for quick performance analysis and decision-making.
